# DSND_Crisp_DM_Project
A Crisp DM Project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree using Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data.

## Installation
I used Python 3.6.7 (Anaconda distribution) for this project. If you are using the Anaconda distribution of Python, 
you will not need to install any additional packages. Otherwise, you will need to install Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
and scikit-learn.

## Project Motivation
I did this project is a part of the second term of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. I decided to work on this project
using Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. The data I used and data for other years can be
retrieved from https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/.
In this project I set out to answer three questions related to overall question of how much data scientists differ from other
developers. The three questions are as follows:
* What programming languages do data scientists use and is there any difference compared to developers in general?
* Do data scientists have different educational backgrounds than other developers?
* Does being successful as a data scientist depend upon factors than being successful as a "normal" developer?

## How to Use
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook file with all the code and detailed explanations. The data_17, data_18 and data_19 
folders contain the data used for my analysis. Please note that due to the size of the CSV files exceeding GitHub's limit of
100 MB per file I uploaded the data using GIT LFS which you can download at https://git-lfs.github.com/. If for some reason, you
cannot use GIT LFS you will need to download the original zip files containing the data from https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/
and copy them to the data_17, data_18 and data_19 files for the notebook to run properly.

## Non-Technical Summary
A non-technical summary of the main findings of my analysis can be found in a Medium blog post at .

## Acknowledgements and Credits
First of all, this notebook is primarily based on what I have learned so far in the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree programme. Hence,
credit needs to be given for the code examples of the different classes of the programme. As mentioned above, the data was retrieved from
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/. It is licensed under the Open Database License (ODbL):

particular Stack Overflow, https://machinelearningmastery.com and https://elitedatascience.com/imbalanced-classes proved very helpful.
Finally, if you would like to make use of my code for your own analyses, please feel free to do so!
